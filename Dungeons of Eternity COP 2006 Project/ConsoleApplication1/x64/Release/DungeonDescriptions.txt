A narrow, dimly lit room with damp stone walls, moss creeping through the cracks, and puddles pooling on the uneven floor.
A circular chamber with a high, domed ceiling, the rough stone etched with faded carvings of an unknown language.
A rectangular room with columns of jagged stone supporting a low ceiling, the air heavy with the smell of earth and mildew.
A spacious hall with a sunken floor, its smooth stone walls scarred with deep claw marks.
A small, square chamber with a single torch flickering weakly, its walls slick with moisture.
A long, narrow corridor with worn stone tiles, the faint sound of dripping water echoing throughout.
A cavernous room filled with stalactites and stalagmites, the stone floor dusted with fine gravel and ash.
A crumbling room with fractured stone walls, a pile of rubble spilling into the center from a collapsed ceiling.
A cold, barren chamber with featureless stone walls, its only decoration a faintly glowing rune etched into the floor.
A claustrophobic room with low stone arches, the walls adorned with faint carvings of intertwined serpents.
